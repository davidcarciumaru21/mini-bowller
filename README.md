# 🤖 Start Code — FTC Team #24037

Welcome to the official repository for **Start Code Robotics (Team #24037)**!

## 🧱 Project Overview

This repository contains our source code and configuration for our first robot of the Decode season.  
Key subsystems include:

- 🕹️ **TeleOp Controls** — driver-focused control with smooth motion profiles
- 🤖 **Autonomous Mode** — AprilTag-based localization and trajectory following
- 🎯 **Vision System** — powered by Vuforia + OpenCV (LifeCam HD-3000 calibrated)
- ⚙️ **Subsystem Architecture** — modular design for easy debugging and upgrades
